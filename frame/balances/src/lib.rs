//! # Balances Pallet
//!
//! The Balances pallet provides functionality for handling accounts and balances.
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//! - [`Pallet`]
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Balances pallet provides functions for:
//!
//! - Getting and setting free balances.
//! - Retrieving total, reserved and unreserved balances.
//! - Repatriating a reserved balance to a beneficiary account that exists.
//! - Transferring a balance between accounts (when not reserved).
//! - Slashing an account balance.
//! - Account creation and removal.
//! - Managing total issuance.
//! - Setting and managing locks.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! - **Existential Deposit:** The minimum balance required to create or keep an account open. This prevents
//! "dust accounts" from filling storage. When the free plus the reserved balance (i.e. the total balance)
//!   fall below this, then the account is said to be dead; and it loses its functionality as well as any
//!   prior history and all information on it is removed from the chain's state.
//!   No account should ever have a total balance that is strictly between 0 and the existential
//!   deposit (exclusive). If this ever happens, it indicates either a bug in this pallet or an
//!   erroneous raw mutation of storage.
//!
//! - **Total Issuance:** The total number of units in existence in a system.
//!
//! - **Reaping an account:** The act of removing an account by resetting its nonce. Happens after its
//! total balance has become zero (or, strictly speaking, less than the Existential Deposit).
//!
//! - **Free Balance:** The portion of a balance that is not reserved. The free balance is the only
//!   balance that matters for most operations.
//!
//! - **Reserved Balance:** Reserved balance still belongs to the account holder, but is suspended.
//!   Reserved balance can still be slashed, but only after all the free balance has been slashed.
//!
//! - **Imbalance:** A condition when some funds were credited or debited without equal and opposite accounting
//! (i.e. a difference between total issuance and account balances). Functions that result in an imbalance will
//! return an object of the `Imbalance` trait that can be managed within your runtime logic. (If an imbalance is
//! simply dropped, it should automatically maintain any book-keeping such as total issuance.)
//!
//! - **Lock:** A freeze on a specified amount of an account's free balance until a specified block number. Multiple
//! locks always operate over the same funds, so they "overlay" rather than "stack".
//!
//! ### Implementations
//!
//! The Balances pallet provides implementations for the following traits. If these traits provide the functionality
//! that you need, then you can avoid coupling with the Balances pallet.
//!
//! - [`Currency`](frame_support::traits::Currency): Functions for dealing with a
//! fungible assets system.
//! - [`ReservableCurrency`](frame_support::traits::ReservableCurrency):
//! Functions for dealing with assets that can be reserved from an account.
//! - [`LockableCurrency`](frame_support::traits::LockableCurrency): Functions for
//! dealing with accounts that allow liquidity restrictions.
//! - [`Imbalance`](frame_support::traits::Imbalance): Functions for handling
//! imbalances between total issuance in the system and account balances. Must be used when a function
//! creates new funds (e.g. a reward) or destroys some funds (e.g. a system fee).
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! - `transfer` - Transfer some liquid free balance to another account.
//! - `set_balance` - Set the balances of a given account. The origin of this call must be root.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The following examples show how to use the Balances pallet in your custom pallet.
//!
//! ### Examples from the FRAME
//!
//! The Contract pallet uses the `Currency` trait to handle gas payment, and its types inherit from `Currency`:
//!
//! ```
//! use frame_support::traits::Currency;
//! # pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
//! # 	type Currency: Currency<Self::AccountId>;
//! # }
//!
//! pub type BalanceOf<T> = <<T as Config>::Currency as Currency<<T as frame_system::Config>::AccountId>>::Balance;
//! pub type NegativeImbalanceOf<T> = <<T as Config>::Currency as Currency<<T as frame_system::Config>::AccountId>>::NegativeImbalance;
//!
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! The Staking pallet uses the `LockableCurrency` trait to lock a stash account's funds:
//!
//! ```
//! use frame_support::traits::{WithdrawReasons, LockableCurrency};
//! use sp_runtime::traits::Bounded;
//! pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
//! 	type Currency: LockableCurrency<Self::AccountId, Moment=Self::BlockNumber>;
//! }
//! # struct StakingLedger<T: Config> {
//! # 	stash: <T as frame_system::Config>::AccountId,
//! # 	total: <<T as Config>::Currency as frame_support::traits::Currency<<T as frame_system::Config>::AccountId>>::Balance,
//! # 	phantom: std::marker::PhantomData<T>,
//! # }
//! # const STAKING_ID: [u8; 8] = *b"staking ";
//!
//! fn update_ledger<T: Config>(
//! 	controller: &T::AccountId,
//! 	ledger: &StakingLedger<T>
//! ) {
//! 	T::Currency::set_lock(
//! 		STAKING_ID,
//! 		&ledger.stash,
//! 		ledger.total,
//! 		WithdrawReasons::all()
//! 	);
//! 	// <Ledger<T>>::insert(controller, ledger); // Commented out as we don't have access to Staking's storage here.
//! }
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! ## Genesis config
//!
//! The Balances pallet depends on the [`GenesisConfig`].
//!
//! ## Assumptions
//!
//! * Total issued balanced of all accounts should be less than `Config::Balance::max_value()`.
